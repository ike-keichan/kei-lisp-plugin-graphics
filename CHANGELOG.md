## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- `createGraphicsPlugin({ canvas })` factory and the `GraphicsPlugin`
  class ported from the legacy `Graphist.js`. Registers 43 `g…`
  Canvas2D drawing primitives callable from Lisp via the kei-lisp v2.2
  plugin contract (`name` / `has` / `apply`).
- Full TypeScript source with strict type checking — `any` and `!`
  assertions removed from production code.

### Fixed

- `gSaveJpeg`, `gSavePng`, and `gSleep` now emit
  `'The canvas is closed and cannot be executed.'` when called while the
  canvas is not open. The JavaScript source emitted the wrong message
  (`'The canvas has already been opened.'`) due to a copy-paste from
  `gOpen`'s double-open guard.
